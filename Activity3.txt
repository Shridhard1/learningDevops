ACTIVITY 3 : Get me IP address of particular domain (guvi.in) How do I find my CPU/memory usage of my server? Test the connectivity between 2 nodes? I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs shows my app is running, but I’m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?

# To get IP Address: 
nslookup guvi.in

#Use This below command to find Memory/CPU usage:
top

#Test the connectivity between 2 nodes?
Created a 2 ec2 instances in aws:

Server1 private ip address: 172.37.78.196
Server2 private ip address: 172.21.20.13

Server1 public ip address:
Server2 public ip address: 51.118.119.322

From Server 1:

# To generate a pubic key
ssh-keygen

# To list the public keys
# Navigate to .ssh directory and isting them
cd .ssh
ls -l

# Coping the id_rsa.pub file content (public key)
cat id_rsa.pub

From Server 2:

# Naviagte to .ssh directory and open authorized_keys file
cd .ssh
ls -l
cat authorized_keys
# Paste the public key in this file

From Server 1:

# SSH to public ip address from server 2
ssh 51.118.119.322

I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs shows my app is running, but I’m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?
# To check the port 9000 is opened or not
# Using lsof
lsof -i:9000

# Using netstat
netstat -tuln | grep 9000
